Shan's Neopixel Sequence EGL 314

Temple Awakening Light Show
This project is a custom NeoPixel light show designed to run on a Raspberry Pi using the rpi_ws281x library. It controls 300 addressable LEDs wrapped around a pedestal, syncing dramatic lighting effects to a soundtrack. The current version includes a complete 40-second sequence with 7 scenes. 


## Features
- 7 lighting scenes (fade-in, pulse, ripple, shimmer, chase, spiral, fade-out)
- Fully customizable color themes
- OSC message support to trigger actions on other devices

## Setup
1. Connect NeoPixel strip to GPIO18 with proper power supply
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt


Here's the code:

# --- LED strip configuration ---
LED_COUNT = 300            # We have 300 tiny lights on the strip
LED_PIN = 18               # The strip is plugged into pin 18 on the Raspberry Pi
LED_FREQ_HZ = 800000       # How fast the lights talk to the Pi (speed)
LED_DMA = 10               # A technical thing to help lights work smoothly
LED_BRIGHTNESS = 255       # How bright the lights should be (max brightness)
LED_INVERT = False         # Don't flip the signal to the lights

# --- Customizable Color Theme --- 
# These are the special colors we will use
BASE_COLOR       = (0, 105, 148)     # Deep Blue color
ACCENT_COLOR     = (139, 69, 19)     # Burnt Amber color (like orange-brown)
SPARKLE_COLOR    = (240, 240, 240)   # Soft White sparkle color

INTRO_COLOR      = (255, 0, 255)     # Bright Magenta (pinkish purple)

# --- OSC Setup --- (talking to another computer before the show)

    try:

        print("Message sent successfully.")                             # Tell us it worked
    except:
        print("Message not sent")                                       # If no, say it failed

# This is the address of the other computer and the message we send it:
PI_A_ADDR = "192.168.254.40"
PORT = 8000
addr = "/action/40044"
msg = float(1)

# Send hello message to the other computer before we start the lights
