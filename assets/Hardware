These are the Hardware components I used and are required to proceed with this Project
 Hardware Components

Raspberry Pi 4  as the main controller. Runs the Python script and sends pixel data to the LEDs.
MicroSD Card (16GB+)	For the Raspberry Pi’s operating system and project files.
5V Power Supply (5V, 10A recommended)	Powers the NeoPixel strip (300 LEDs can draw up to 18A at full brightness).
NeoPixel LED Strip (WS2812B, 300 LEDs)	Individually addressable RGB LEDs to create stunning animations.
Jumper Wires / Breadboard	For wiring and prototyping. Helps with connections between components.
Ground Wire (GND Bridge)	A simple wire connecting the Raspberry Pi’s GND pin to the GND of the LED power supply. This ensures a shared electrical reference and stabilizes the signal.
